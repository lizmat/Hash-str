NAME
====

Hash::str - provide a hash with native string keys

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use Hash::str;

my %hash is Hash::str = fortytwo => "foo", sixsixsix => "bar";
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

Hash::str is module that provides the `Hash::str` class to be applied to the initialization of an Associative, making it limit the keys to native string. This allows this module to take some shortcuts, but only have a very limited (a few %_) performance improvement, so you should really only use this module if you're looking at getting those last few percent.
